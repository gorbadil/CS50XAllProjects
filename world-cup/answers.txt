Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

When simulates are smaller then 1000, middle side of ranking changed.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

After 1000000, changes of teams similarly idantical.
