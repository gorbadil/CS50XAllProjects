If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

We could do that with comparing one listener songs and top songs. We could understand listeners how much like pop songs.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Maybe we need more data for this songs. metronom maybe or avg hz for sons.
